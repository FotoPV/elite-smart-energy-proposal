# Reference Project Analysis - Wayne Llewellyn Proposal

## Key Observations

### Slide Structure (16 slides, not 25)
1. COVER PAGE - Full-bleed cover with background image, logo, title, customer details
2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - Current cost, recommended system, annual savings, payback, key insight
3. CURRENT BILL ANALYSIS - Detailed breakdown: usage, costs, rate structure analysis
4. MONTHLY USAGE ANALYSIS - 9-month consumption pattern vs solar generation chart
5. YEARLY COST PROJECTION - 10-year projection with 3.5% inflation impact
6. STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT - Underutilised solar, feed-in tariff erosion, VPP opportunities
7. RECOMMENDED BATTERY SIZE - Specific battery model, sizing breakdown for overnight + VPP
8. EXISTING SOLAR ASSESSMENT - Solar performance review, battery impact on self-consumption
9. VPP PROVIDER COMPARISON - Comparison table of 6 VPP providers
10. VPP RECOMMENDATION - Detailed analysis of recommended VPP program
11. TOTAL SAVINGS SUMMARY - Visual summary of annual savings vs current costs
12. FINANCIAL SUMMARY & PAYBACK - Net cost after rebates, payback period, 10yr/25yr ROI
13. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT - CO2 reduction, trees equivalent, energy independence score
14. RECOMMENDED ROADMAP - 4-phase implementation timeline
15. CONCLUSION - Final synthesis of key value propositions
16. GET IN TOUCH - Contact details with branding

### Quality Standards Observed
- **Deep black backgrounds** throughout
- **Minimal style** - clean, data-driven layouts
- **Batch generation** of slides (4-5 at a time)
- **Consistent branding** - black bg, aqua, orange accent
- **Data-driven** - specific numbers, not generic placeholders
- **Strategic language** - "capturing wasted value", "financial return", "environmental leadership"
- **Professional tone** - HIGH LEVEL OF EDUCATED PUBLICS audience

### Key Data Points Referenced
- Current State: 73% of solar exported for minimal return (3.1c/kWh)
- Solution: 16.12kWh Sigenergy SigenStor battery → 85% self-consumption
- VPP Strategy: Origin Battery Lite adds ~$400 first-year value
- Financial: $1,622 annual savings, 6.2-year payback
- Environmental: 3.5 tonnes CO2 eliminated annually

### What "Too Rapid and Skimmish" Means
The current implementation generates slides with generic placeholder data and surface-level analysis.
The reference project shows:
- **Specific bill data** extracted and tabulated (not generic)
- **Strategic analysis** with insights (not just numbers)
- **Visual charts** showing consumption patterns over 9 months
- **Comparison tables** with real VPP providers
- **Implementation roadmap** with phases
- **Environmental quantification** with specific metrics
- **Each slide tells a story** with context and recommendations

### Approach: Manus Slides (Image Mode)
The reference project used Manus Slides to generate pixel-perfect image-based slides.
This is the approach we should use — NOT HTML iframes or PDFKit.
The slides were generated in batches of 4-5 at a time using the `slides` tool with `image` mode.
