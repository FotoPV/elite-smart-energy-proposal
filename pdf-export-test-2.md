Issues:
1. Right side content is cut off - the page width may be too wide for the PDF viewer, or the right-side cards are positioned off-screen
2. The page is 1920x1080 points which is very large - should use a more standard size like 1280x720 or scale down
3. Some slides in thumbnails (3, 4) appear to have grey/white areas - need to check content

The data IS flowing through correctly - customer costs, system recommendations, and contact info are all present.
