# Slide 4: MONTHLY USAGE ANALYSIS

## Design
- **Background**: Black (#000000)
- **Logo**: Top-right corner
- **Heading**: "MONTHLY USAGE ANALYSIS" in NextSphere, white
- **Subtitle**: "Consumption Pattern & Solar Opportunity" in Urbanist Italic, aqua
- **Aqua line separator**

## Content Layout: Bar chart showing 12-month usage pattern

### Monthly Consumption Chart (full width bar chart)
A bar chart showing estimated monthly consumption across 12 months:

| Month | Usage (kWh) | Type |
|-------|-------------|------|
| Jan | 87 | Summer (low) |
| Feb | 87 | Summer (low) |
| Mar | 105 | Autumn |
| Apr | 122 | Autumn |
| May | 140 | Winter onset |
| Jun | 157 | Winter peak |
| Jul | 157 | Winter peak |
| Aug | 145 | Winter |
| Sep | 128 | Spring |
| Oct | 111 | Spring |
| Nov | 99 | Summer onset |
| Dec | 87 | Summer (low) |

- **Aqua bars** for each month
- **Orange dashed line** showing the annual average (116 kWh/month)
- **Winter months highlighted** with slightly brighter bars

### Key Statistics (3 cards below chart)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual Consumption | 1,416 kWh |
| Monthly Average | 116 kWh |
| Daily Average | 3.9 kWh |

### Insight Box (aqua left border)
Winter months (June–August) show consumption 35% above the annual average, driven by heating loads. This seasonal variation creates an ideal use case for battery storage — storing excess solar during summer for winter evening consumption, while VPP participation generates income during peak demand events that typically coincide with these high-consumption periods.

## Style Notes
- Bar chart should be visually prominent, taking 60% of slide height
- Each bar labelled with month abbreviation below
- Average line clearly visible with label

- **Aqua line separator**

## Content Layout: Rising cost chart + cumulative table

### 10-Year Cost Projection Table

| Year | Annual Cost | Cumulative Spend |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| 2026 (Current) | $788 | $788 |
| 2027 | $815 | $1,603 |
| 2028 | $844 | $2,447 |
| 2029 | $873 | — |
| 2030 | $904 | — |
| 2031 | $936 | — |
| 2032 | $968 | — |
| 2033 | $1,002 | — |
| 2034 | $1,037 | — |
| 2035 | $1,074 | — |

### Visual: Rising bar chart showing escalating costs
- Bars grow taller each year (orange bars)
- A horizontal aqua dashed line showing "with solar + battery" flat cost
- The gap between the two lines represents cumulative savings

### Key Metrics (2 cards)

| Metric | Value | Color |
|--------|-------|-------|
| 10-YEAR COST (NO ACTION) | $9,242 | Orange |
| 10-YEAR SAVINGS (WITH SYSTEM) | $9,560 | Aqua |

### Insight Box (orange left border — warning tone)
At the current 3.5% annual electricity price inflation, your energy costs will increase by 41% over the next decade. Without intervention, the cumulative expenditure represents a significant financial commitment that could be substantially reduced through strategic investment in battery storage and energy optimisation.

## Style Notes
- The escalating bars should create a visual sense of urgency
- Orange colour for the "without action" scenario
- Aqua for the "with system" comparison line

# Slide 6: STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT

## Design
- **Background**: Black (#000000)
- **Logo**: Top-right corner
- **Heading**: "STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT" in NextSphere, white
- **Subtitle**: "Opportunity Analysis" in Urbanist Italic, aqua
- **Aqua line separator**

## Content Layout: 3 strategic insight cards stacked vertically

### Strategic Insight 1: Solar Opportunity
**Card** (dark bg, aqua left border)
With 1,416 kWh of annual consumption, a solar system would offset a significant portion of your grid dependency. Combined with battery storage, self-consumption rates of 80-85% are achievable, dramatically reducing your energy costs.

### Strategic Insight 2: Feed-in Tariff Erosion
**Card** (dark bg, orange left border)
Feed-in tariffs across VIC have been declining steadily and are projected to continue falling as rooftop solar penetration increases. Current feed-in rates will likely decrease further, making self-consumption through battery storage increasingly valuable. Acting now locks in the maximum benefit from your solar generation.

### Strategic Insight 3: VPP Revenue Opportunity
**Card** (dark bg, aqua left border)
Virtual Power Plant programs offer a compelling additional revenue stream. By allowing controlled discharge during grid peak events, your battery can earn $405+ annually while maintaining sufficient reserve for household needs. This transforms your battery from a cost-saving device into an income-generating asset.

## Style Notes
- Each card should be substantial (roughly 1/3 of content area)
- Aqua borders for opportunities, orange for risks/warnings
- Strategic language — this slide sets the narrative for the rest of the proposal

## Content Layout: Battery spec card + sizing breakdown

### Recommended Battery (large feature card, aqua border)

| Specification | Detail |
|--------------|--------|
| **Model** | Sigenergy SigenStor |
| **Capacity** | 10.0 kWh |
| **Estimated Cost** | $0 |
| **Battery Rebate** | -$0 |
| **Net Cost** | $0 |

### Sizing Breakdown (how the battery size was determined)

| Component | kWh Required |
|-----------|-------------|
| Overnight household consumption (6pm–6am) | 2.1 kWh |
| Morning peak coverage (6am–9am) | 0.6 kWh |
| VPP reserve allocation | 2.0 kWh |
| Buffer for degradation (10%) | 1.0 kWh |
| **Total Recommended** | **10.0 kWh** |

### Insight Box (aqua left border)
The 10.0 kWh battery is sized to cover your overnight consumption while maintaining a 20% reserve for VPP trading events. This balanced approach maximises both self-consumption savings and VPP income, delivering the optimal return on investment for your usage profile.

## Style Notes
- Battery model name should be prominent
- Sizing breakdown should use a visual stacked bar showing each component
- The net cost (after rebate) should be highlighted in aqua
