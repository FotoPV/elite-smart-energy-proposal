# Bill Analysis Page Review

## What's Working
- "BILL ANALYSIS" heading in NextSphere font - correct
- Subtitle "View and download your electricity bill analysis" - correct
- Dark card with FileText icon, "BILL ANALYSIS" title, customer name, Open and Download buttons - correct
- Download button is filled aqua, Open button is ghost aqua - correct
- Slides are rendering below in scrollable cards
- Cover slide showing "ELITE SMART ENERGY SOLUTIONS" logo
- Executive Summary slide visible below
- Clean dark background with thin borders

## Issues to Fix
- The slide iframes have white scrollbars visible - need to hide them
- The cover slide is showing but the content seems cut off (only logo visible, not the full cover)
- Need to ensure iframe scaling is correct so full slide content is visible
