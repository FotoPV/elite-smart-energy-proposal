# Cover Page Design Notes

The SLIDE COVER PAGE PDF shows:
- Black background with a futuristic solar panel/house/EV charger illustration on the right side
- The illustration features grey/dark tones with aqua (#00EAD3) glowing accents (circuit lines, light beams)
- The left side is mostly black - this is where the text content goes (logo, title, customer name)
- The illustration shows: solar panels on a roof, an EV charger with aqua glow, circuit board patterns
- Small aqua dots scattered like stars
- Very professional, tech-forward aesthetic

This background image needs to be uploaded to CDN and used as the cover slide background.
