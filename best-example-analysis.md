## DASHBOARD COMPARISON - ISSUES TO FIX:
The dashboard UI should mirror these same design patterns:
1. Dashboard stat cards should use thin aqua borders (not solid aqua fills)
2. Engagement analytics cards should NOT be solid aqua - use thin borders only
3. All text should follow the same font hierarchy
4. Quick action cards should have thin grey borders, not heavy styling
5. The overall feel should be clean, minimal, professional - matching the slides
