# Export Dropdown Test

The export dropdown is working correctly with three options:
1. PDF - Embedded brand fonts (orange icon)
2. PowerPoint - Editable .pptx file (aqua icon)
3. HTML PDF - Browser-rendered slides (grey icon)

The dropdown styling matches the brand - dark background, proper text colors.
The cover slide shows the background image with Elite Smart Energy Solutions logo.
The Executive Summary slide is visible below with proper data.

Next: Test the PDF export to verify it generates correctly.
